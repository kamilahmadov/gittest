# HOW TO OPEN BASH IN TERMINAL
The easiest way is to press down CTRL + SHIFT + P and then type in “select default profile“.

The drop-down includes every shell that is installed in your system that VS Code was able to detect.

Now simply select Git Bash and open up a new terminal window by pressing down CTRL + SHIFT + ~ (tilde) to check if Git Bash opens up as the default terminal.
